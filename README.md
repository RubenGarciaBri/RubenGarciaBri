I'm a Frontend Engineer based in London, UK. Currently working for BehaviourLab, a Fintech startup that helps asset managers, private equity firms, insurance companies and executive boards make better financial decisions through analytics and behavioural science.

The main technologies I work with on a daily basis are React, Next.js, Typescript, TailwindCSS and D3.
